Assignment 27.1

1. Return the categories (names) of the longest film. NOTE that there may be several "longest"
films (i.e. with the same length), so you might need to return more than one category. Return
the duration as well.

Answer: select category,length,duration from film_list where length = (select max(length) from film_list);


2. Find the movies whose total number of actors is above the average. Return the movie names
And its number of actors ordered by the title. IMPORTANT NOTE: this query should return many
Movies. Please write in your submission only the first TOP-10 results.

Answer: In the tables there is no column with number of actors. Hence average cannot be found.                                Hence movie names and its number of actors ordered by the title cannot be found.
